# GenVision-Image-Generation-with-GANs
This project implements a GAN using PyTorch to generate realistic images. It consists of a Generator that creates new images and a Discriminator that evaluates them. Through adversarial training, the model learns to produce high-quality images from a given dataset.

## 🧠 **Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using **PyTorch**. The GAN is trained on a dataset of real images to generate new, never-before-seen images through the interplay of two neural networks:  
- **Generator:** Creates synthetic images.  
- **Discriminator:** Evaluates image authenticity (real or generated).

## 📊 **Key Features**  
- **PyTorch Implementation:** Efficient model building and training.  
- **Adversarial Training:** Continuous improvement of both Generator and Discriminator.  
- **Realistic Image Generation:** Produces synthetic images.
